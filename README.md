# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 challenges.

## Description

Advent of Code is an annual event consisting of daily programming puzzles throughout the month of December. Each day a new challenge is released and participants are invited to solve the puzzle using any programming language of their choice.

## Solutions

Each day's solution is contained in a separate folder named dayXX where XX represents the day number (01-25). Within each day's folder, you will find a Python file named solution.py and solution2.py containing the solutions for both parts of that day's puzzle. You can modify the input file provided in each directory to test the solution with different inputs.
